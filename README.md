# Final-Project
 Student Performance & Failure Risk Analysis
A Data-Driven Exploration of Academic Outcomes

📌  Overview
This project analyzes academic performance among high school students by identifying key risk factors contributing to failure. Using a dataset that combines performance in both Mathematics and Portuguese, the study investigates how lifestyle, family background, and academic behavior influence grades.

🎯 Objectives
Understand what factors most affect student success or failure

Identify students at risk based on measurable indicators

Compare performance between subjects and schools

Provide actionable recommendations for educators and policymakers

📊 Dataset Details
Source: UCI Student Performance Dataset

Subjects: Mathematics & Portuguese

Total Students: 383

Key Variables:

Final grades (G1, G2, G3)

Study time

Alcohol consumption

Parental education and job

Absences

Support programs (school and family)

🔎 Key Insights
Students with low study time, high absences, or low parental education are significantly more likely to fail.

Support programs (school and family) are positively linked to pass rates.

Alcohol consumption (especially during weekends) negatively correlates with final grades.

A risk score was developed to classify students into low, moderate, and high-risk categories.

📈 Visualizations

🧠 Methodology
Data Preparation

Merged Math and Portuguese datasets

Created combined indicators (e.g., support factor, average G3, risk score)

Cleaned and transformed categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis

Bar charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots to understand trends

Calculated pass/fail status

Segmented students by risk profiles

Risk Modeling (Descriptive)

Identified 5 key risk factors

Built a cumulative Risk Score (0–5)

Visualized failure likelihood by risk level

📢 Recommendations
Encourage students to study at least 5–10 hours per week

Raise awareness of the academic impact of alcohol use

Provide early interventions for students with high absences

Expand access to support programs, especially for students from low-education households

👩‍🏫 For Educators & Schools
This analysis can be adapted to monitor student performance across schools and design targeted interventions. Future improvements include:

Predictive modeling for early warning systems

Real-time dashboards for schools and administrators

Tailored recommendations for student engagement
